====================================================
Export task and verifications into external services
====================================================

Currently Rally stores all information about executed tasks and verifications
in its database and it is also able to provide this data in JSON format or
in the form of HTML reports. There is a request for Rally to export this data
into external services (like test management system or Google Docs)
via its API.

Problem description
===================

There are many, including a lot of proprietary, test management systems
in the market available as SaaS and/or On-Premises, like TestRail, TestLink,
TestLodge etc, which objective is to manage, organize and track all testing
efforts.

Most of the systems provide an API for importing test data. The systems also
possess data model somewhat similar to Rally's one.
It usually includes (among others) models for project, test suite test case,
test plan and test execution results.

It is suggested to provide Rally users an ability to export information about
testing their environments into such test management systems in order
to integrate benchmarking via Rally into rest of their testing activities.

Since different test management systems have alike yet different API
for the purpose it is reasonable to implement this export functionality via
plugins.

Proposed change
===============

1. Implement a base class TaskExporter for an export plugin at
*rally/task/exporter.py*.

..code-block:: python

    class TaskExporter(plugin.Plugin):
        def export(self, task, connection_string):
            ...

2. Implement a CLI command of the form

..code-block:: shell

    rally task export <UUID> <CONNECTION_STRING>

3. Implement a base class VerifyExporter for an export plugin at
*rally/verify/exporter.py*.

..code-block:: python

    class VerifyExporter(plugin.Plugin):
        def export(self, verification, connection_string):
            ...

4. Implement a CLI command of the form

..code-block:: shell

    rally verify export <UUID> <CONNECTION_STRING>
