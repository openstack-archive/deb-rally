Step 7. Working with multiple OpenStack clouds
==============================================

Rally is an awesome tool that allows you to work with multiple clouds and can itself deploy them. We already know how to work with :ref:`a single cloud <tutorial_step_1_setting_up_env_and_running_benchmark_from_samples>`. Let us now register 2 clouds in Rally: the one that we have access to and the other that we know is registered with wrong credentials.

.. code-block:: console

    $ . openrc admin admin  # openrc with correct credentials
    $ rally deployment create --fromenv --name=cloud-1
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    | uuid                                 | created_at                 | name       | status           | active |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    | 4251b491-73b2-422a-aecb-695a94165b5e | 2015-01-18 00:11:14.757203 | cloud-1    | deploy->finished |        |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    Using deployment: 4251b491-73b2-422a-aecb-695a94165b5e
    ~/.rally/openrc was updated
    ...

    $ . bad_openrc admin admin  # openrc with wrong credentials
    $ rally deployment create --fromenv --name=cloud-2
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    | uuid                                 | created_at                 | name       | status           | active |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    | 658b9bae-1f9c-4036-9400-9e71e88864fc | 2015-01-18 00:38:26.127171 | cloud-2    | deploy->finished |        |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    Using deployment: 658b9bae-1f9c-4036-9400-9e71e88864fc
    ~/.rally/openrc was updated
    ...

Let us now list the deployments we have created:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rally deployment list
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    | uuid                                 | created_at                 | name       | status           | active |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+
    | 4251b491-73b2-422a-aecb-695a94165b5e | 2015-01-05 00:11:14.757203 | cloud-1    | deploy->finished |        |
    | 658b9bae-1f9c-4036-9400-9e71e88864fc | 2015-01-05 00:40:58.451435 | cloud-2    | deploy->finished | *      |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+------------+------------------+--------+

Note that the second is marked as **"active"** because this is the deployment we have created most recently. This means that it will be automatically (unless its UUID or name is passed explicitly via the *--deployment* parameter) used by the commands that need a deployment, like *rally task start ...* or *rally deployment check*:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rally deployment check
    Authentication Issues: wrong keystone credentials specified in your endpoint properties. (HTTP 401).

    $ rally deployment check --deployment=cloud-1
    keystone endpoints are valid and following services are available:
    +----------+----------------+-----------+
    | services | type           | status    |
    +----------+----------------+-----------+
    | cinder   | volume         | Available |
    | cinderv2 | volumev2       | Available |
    | ec2      | ec2            | Available |
    | glance   | image          | Available |
    | heat     | orchestration  | Available |
    | heat-cfn | cloudformation | Available |
    | keystone | identity       | Available |
    | nova     | compute        | Available |
    | novav21  | computev21     | Available |
    | s3       | s3             | Available |
    +----------+----------------+-----------+

You can also switch the active deployment using the **rally deployment use** command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rally deployment use cloud-1
    Using deployment: 658b9bae-1f9c-4036-9400-9e71e88864fc
    ~/.rally/openrc was updated
    ...

    $ rally deployment check
    keystone endpoints are valid and following services are available:
    +----------+----------------+-----------+
    | services | type           | status    |
    +----------+----------------+-----------+
    | cinder   | volume         | Available |
    | cinderv2 | volumev2       | Available |
    | ec2      | ec2            | Available |
    | glance   | image          | Available |
    | heat     | orchestration  | Available |
    | heat-cfn | cloudformation | Available |
    | keystone | identity       | Available |
    | nova     | compute        | Available |
    | novav21  | computev21     | Available |
    | s3       | s3             | Available |
    +----------+----------------+-----------+

Note the first two lines of the CLI output for the *rally deployment use* command. They tell you the UUID of the new active deployment and also say that the *~/.rally/openrc* file was updated -- this is the place where the "active" UUID is actually stored by Rally.

One last detail about managing different deployments in Rally is that the *rally task list* command outputs only those tasks that were run against the currently active deployment, and you have to provide the *--all-deployments* parameter to list all the tasks:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rally task list
    +--------------------------------------+-----------------+----------------------------+----------------+----------+--------+-----+
    | uuid                                 | deployment_name | created_at                 | duration       | status   | failed | tag |
