Step 0. Installation
====================

The easiest way to install Rally is by running its `installation script
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/rally/master/install_rally.sh>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -q -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/rally/master/install_rally.sh | bash
    # or using curl:
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/rally/master/install_rally.sh | bash

If you execute the script as regular user, Rally will create a new
virtual environment in ``~/rally/`` and install in it Rally, and will
use `sqlite` as database backend. If you execute the script as root,
Rally will be installed system wide. For more installation options,
please refer to the :ref:`installation <install>` page.

**Note:** Rally requires Python version 2.6, 2.7 or 3.4.

Now that you have rally installed, you are ready to start :ref:`benchmarking OpenStack with it <tutorial_step_1_setting_up_env_and_running_benchmark_from_samples>`!
