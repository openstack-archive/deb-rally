What is Rally?
==============

**OpenStack** is, undoubtedly, a really *huge* ecosystem of cooperative services. **Rally** is a **benchmarking tool** that answers the question: **"How does OpenStack work at scale?"**. To make this possible, Rally **automates** and **unifies** multi-node OpenStack deployment, cloud verification, benchmarking & profiling. Rally does it in a **generic** way, making it possible to check whether OpenStack is going to work well on, say, a 1k-servers installation under high load. Thus it can be used as a basic tool for an *OpenStack CI/CD system* that would continuously improve its SLA, performance and stability.
