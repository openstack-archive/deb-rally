Rally OS Gates
==============

Gate jobs
---------

The **Openstack CI system** uses the so-called **"Gate jobs"** to control merges of patched submitted for review on Gerrit. These **Gate jobs** usually just launch a set of tests -- unit, functional, integration, style -- that check that the proposed patch does not break the software and can be merged into the target branch, thus providing additional guarantees for the stability of the software.


Create a custom Rally Gate job
------------------------------

You can create a **Rally Gate job** for your project to run Rally benchmarks against the patchsets proposed to be merged into your project.

To create a rally-gate job, you should create a **rally-jobs/** directory at the root of your project.

As a rule, this directory contains only **{projectname}.yaml**, but more scenarios and jobs can be added as well. This yaml file is in fact an input Rally task file specifying benchmark scenarios that should be run in your gate job.

To make *{projectname}.yaml* run in gates, you need to add *"rally-jobs"* to the "jobs" section of *projects.yaml* in *openstack-infra/project-config*.


Example: Rally Gate job for Glance
----------------------------------

Let's take a look at an example for the `Glance <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Glance>`_ project:

Edit *jenkins/jobs/projects.yaml:*

.. parsed-literal::

   - project:
       name: glance
       node: 'bare-precise || bare-trusty'
       tarball-site: tarballs.openstack.org
       doc-publisher-site: docs.openstack.org

       jobs:
         - python-jobs
         - python-icehouse-bitrot-jobs
         - python-juno-bitrot-jobs
         - openstack-publish-jobs
         - translation-jobs
         **- rally-jobs**


Also add *gate-rally-dsvm-{projectname}* to *zuul/layout.yaml*:

.. parsed-literal::

   - name: openstack/glance
     template:
       - name: merge-check
       - name: python26-jobs
       - name: python-jobs
       - name: openstack-server-publish-jobs
       - name: openstack-server-release-jobs
       - name: periodic-icehouse
       - name: periodic-juno
       - name: check-requirements
       - name: integrated-gate
       - name: translation-jobs
       - name: large-ops
       - name: experimental-tripleo-jobs
     check:
       - check-devstack-dsvm-cells
       **- gate-rally-dsvm-glance**
     gate:
       - gate-devstack-dsvm-cells
     experimental:
       - gate-grenade-dsvm-forward


To add one more scenario and job, you need to add *{scenarioname}.yaml* file here, and *gate-rally-dsvm-{scenarioname}* to *projects.yaml*.

For example, you can add *myscenario.yaml* to *rally-jobs* directory in your project and then edit *jenkins/jobs/projects.yaml* in this way:

.. parsed-literal::

   - project:
       name: glance
       github-org: openstack
       node: bare-precise
       tarball-site: tarballs.openstack.org
       doc-publisher-site: docs.openstack.org

       jobs:
         - python-jobs
         - python-havana-bitrot-jobs
         - openstack-publish-jobs
         - translation-jobs
         - rally-jobs
         **- 'gate-rally-dsvm-{name}':
           name: myscenario**

Finally, add *gate-rally-dsvm-myscenario* to *zuul/layout.yaml*:

.. parsed-literal::

   - name: openstack/glance
     template:
       - name: python-jobs
       - name: openstack-server-publish-jobs
       - name: periodic-havana
       - name: check-requirements
       - name: integrated-gate
     check:
       - check-devstack-dsvm-cells
       - check-tempest-dsvm-postgres-full
       - gate-tempest-dsvm-large-ops
       - gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-large-ops
       **- gate-rally-dsvm-myscenario**

It is also possible to arrange your input task files as templates based on jinja2. Say, you want to set the image names used throughout the *myscenario.yaml* task file as a variable parameter. Then, replace concrete image names in this file with a variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ...

    NovaServers.boot_and_delete_server:
      -
        args:
          image:
              name: {{image_name}}
        ...

    NovaServers.boot_and_list_server:
      -
        args:
          image:
              name: {{image_name}}
        ...

and create a file named *myscenario_args.yaml* that will define the parameter values:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

      image_name: "^cirros.*uec$"

this file will be automatically used by Rally to substitute the variables in *myscenario.yaml*.


Plugins & Extras in Rally Gate jobs
-----------------------------------

Along with scenario configs in yaml, the **rally-jobs** directory can also contain two subdirectories:

- **plugins**: :ref:`Plugins <plugins>` needed for your gate job;
- **extra**: auxiliary files like bash scripts or images.

Both subdirectories will be copied to *~/.rally/* before the job gets started.
