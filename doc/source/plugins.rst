Rally Plugins
=============


Rally Plugin Reference
----------------------

Rally has a plugin oriented architecture - in other words Rally team is trying
to make all places of code pluggable. Such architecture leds to the big amount
of plugins. :ref:`Rally Plugins Reference page <plugin_reference>` contains a
full list with detailed descriptions of all official Rally plugins.


How plugins work
----------------

Rally provides an opportunity to create and use a **custom benchmark
scenario, runner, SLA, deployment or context** as a **plugin**:

Placement
---------

Plugins can be quickly written and used, with no need to contribute
them to the actual Rally code. Just place a python module with your
plugin class into the ``/opt/rally/plugins`` or ``~/.rally/plugins``
directory (or its subdirectories), and it will be
autoloaded. Additional paths can be specified with the
``--plugin-paths`` argument, or with the ``RALLY_PLUGIN_PATHS``
environment variable, both of which accept comma-delimited
lists. Both ``--plugin-paths`` and ``RALLY_PLUGIN_PATHS`` can list
either plugin module files, or directories containing plugins. For
instance, both of these are valid:

.. code-block:: bash

    rally --plugin-paths /rally/plugins ...
    rally --plugin-paths /rally/plugins/foo.py,/rally/plugins/bar.py ...

You can also use a script ``unpack_plugins_samples.sh`` from
``samples/plugins`` which will automatically create the
``~/.rally/plugins`` directory.

How to create a plugin
----------------------

To create your own plugin you need to inherit your plugin class from
plugin.Plugin class or its subclasses. Also you need to decorate your class
with ``rally.task.scenario.configure``

.. code-block:: python

    from rally.task import scenario

    @scenario.configure(name="my_new_plugin_name")
    class MyNewPlugin(plugin.Plugin):
        pass
