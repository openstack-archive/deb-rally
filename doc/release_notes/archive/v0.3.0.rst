Details
-------

This release, as well as all previous ones, includes a lot of internal and
external changes. Most important of them are listed below.

.. warning:: In this release Rally DB schema migration is introduced. While
    upgrading Rally from previous versions it is required now to run
    ``rally-manade db upgrade``. Please see 'Documentation' section for details.


CLI changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* .. warning:: [Removed] ``rally info`` in favor of ``rally plugin *``.
  It was deprecated for a long time.

* [Modified] ``rally deployment check`` now prints services, which don't have
  names, since such services can be used via api_versions context.

* .. warning:: [Modified] ``rally verify [re]install``
      option --no-tempest-venv was deprecated in favor of --system-wide

* [Added] ``rally-manage db revision`` displays current revision of
  Rally database schema

* [Added] ``rally-manage db upgrade`` upgrades pre-existing Rally
  database schema to the latest revision

* [Added] ``rally-manage db downgrade`` to downgrades existing Rally
  database schema to previous revision

* [Added] ``rally task export`` exports task results to external
  services (only CLI command introduced, no real service support
  implemented yet, however one could write own plugins)

* [Added] ``rally verify export`` exports verification results to
  external services (only CLI command introduced, no real service support
  implemented yet, however one could write own plugins)

Rally Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* .. warning:: ``fuel`` deployment engine is removed since it was outdated and
      lacked both usage and support

Rally Task
~~~~~~~~~~

Add custom labels for "Scenario Output" charts

* X-axis label can be specified to add_output() by
  "axis_label" key of chart options dict.
  The key is named "axis_label" but not "x_label"
  because chart can be displayed as table, so we explicitly
  mention "axis" in option name to make this parameter
  useless for tables

* Y-axis label can be specified to add_output() by
  "label" key of chart options dict
  In some cases this parameter can be used for rendering
  tables - it becomes column name in case if chart with
  single iteration is transformed into table

* As mentiones above, if we have output chart
  with single iteration, then it is transformed to table,
  because chart with single value is useless

* OutputLinesChart is added, it is displayed by
  NVD3 lineChart()

* Chart "description" is optional now. Description is
  not shown if it is not specified explicitly

* Scenario Dummy.add_output is improved to display labels
  and OutputLinesChart

* Fix: If Y-values are too long and overlaps chart box,
  then JavaScript updates chart width in runtime to fit
  width of chart graphs + Y values to their DOM container

Rally Certification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 None.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

**7 bugs were fixed**:

  but Rally is passing one (tenant_id).

* #1543414: The `rally verify start` command fails when running
  a verification against Kilo OpenStack
