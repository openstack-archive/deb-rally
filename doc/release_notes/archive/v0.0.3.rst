Details
-------

This release contains new features, new benchmark plugins, bug fixes,
various code and API improvements.


New Features & API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


    * Add the ability to specify versions for clients in benchmark scenarios

      You can call self.clients("glance", "2") and get any client for
      specific version.

    * Add API for tempest uninstall

      $ rally-manage tempest uninstall
      # removes fully tempest for active deployment


    * Add a --uuids-only option to rally task list

        $ rally task list --uuids-only   # returns list with only task uuids

    * Adds endpoint to --fromenv deployment creation

        $ rally deployment create --fromenv
        # recognizes standard OS_ENDPOINT environment variable

    * Configure SSL per deployment

        Now SSL information is deployment specific not Rally specific and
        rally.conf option is deprecated

        Like in this sample
        https://github.com/openstack/rally/blob/14d0b5ba0c75ececfdb6a6c121d9cf2810571f77/samples/deployments/existing.json#L11-L12


Specs
~~~~~

    * [spec] Proposal for new task input file format

      This spec describes new task input format that will allow us to generate
      multi scenario load which is crucial for HA and more real life testing:

      https://github.com/openstack/rally/blob/master/doc/specs/in-progress/new_rally_input_task_format.rst


Plugins
~~~~~~~

* **Benchmark Scenario Runners**:

    * Add a maximum concurrency option to rps runner

      To avoid running to heavy load you can set 'concurrency' to configuration
      and in case if cloud is not able to process all requests it won't start
      more parallel requests then 'concurrency' value.


* **Benchmark Scenarios**:

    [new] CeilometerAlarms.create_alarm_and_get_history

    [new] KeystoneBasic.get_entities

    [new] EC2Servers.boot_server

    [new] KeystoneBasic.create_and_delete_service

    [new] MuranoEnvironments.list_environments

    [new] MuranoEnvironments.create_and_delete_environment

    [new] NovaServers.suspend_and_resume_server

    [new] NovaServers.pause_and_unpause_server

    [new] NovaServers.boot_and_rebuild_server

    [new] KeystoneBasic.create_and_list_services

    [new] HeatStacks.list_stacks_and_events

    [improved] VMTask.boot_runcommand_delete

        restore ability to use fixed IP and floating IP to connect to VM
        via ssh

    [fix] NovaServers.boot_server_attach_created_volume_and_live_migrate

        Kwargs in nova scenario were wrongly passed



* **Benchmark SLA**:

    * [new] aborted_on_sla

    This is internal SLA criteria, that is added if task was aborted


    * [new] something_went_wrong

    This is internal SLA criteria, that is added if something went wrong,
    context failed to create or runner raised some exceptions


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

**14 bugs were fixed, the most critical are**:

    * Set default task uuid to running task. Before it was set only after
      task was fully finished.

    * The "rally task results" command showed a disorienting "task not found"
      message for a task that is currently running.

    * Rally didn't know how to reconnect to OpenStack in case if token
      expired.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New tutorial **task templates**

https://rally.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/step_5_task_templates.html

* Various fixes
